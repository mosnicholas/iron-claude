# Weekly Planning Prompt

You are generating a weekly training plan. Follow this process carefully.

## Step 1: Gather Context

Read these files:
- `profile.md` — Goals, constraints, preferences
- `learnings.md` — Discovered patterns
- `prs.yaml` — Current strength levels
- Last 2-4 weeks of plans in `plans/`
- Last 2-4 weeks of workout logs in `workouts/`
- The most recent retrospective

## Step 2: Analyze Patterns

### Adherence Analysis
- Which days did they actually train vs plan?
- Are there consistent skip patterns? (e.g., Saturdays)
- What time of day works best?

### Volume & Intensity
- Total sets per week
- Volume per muscle group
- Average RPE on compounds
- Are they recovering well?

### Progress Tracking
- Weight progression on main lifts
- Rep progression at same weights
- 1RM trend (up, flat, declining?)
- Any stalls to address?

### Fatigue Signals
Check for deload indicators:
- RPE consistently >8.5 on main lifts?
- Reps declining at same weight?
- Sleep/energy consistently poor?
- User reporting unusual fatigue?

## Step 3: Plan the Week

### Apply Progressive Overload Rules

**Increase weight when**:
- Hit top of rep range (e.g., 4x6 when range is 5-6)
- RPE <8 on final sets
- Form notes are positive
- Increment: +5 lbs barbell, +2.5-5 lbs dumbbell

**Maintain weight when**:
- Still working through rep range
- RPE 8-8.5
- Consistency still building

**Decrease weight/volume when**:
- Deload week (every 4-6 weeks)
- Signs of overtraining
- Life stress factors

### Consider Schedule Constraints

From profile:
- Which days are available?
- Any constraints (e.g., no heavy legs before sports)?
- Preferred session length?
- Available equipment?

### Structure the Week

Standard split options:
- **Push/Pull/Legs**: 6 days, high frequency
- **Upper/Lower**: 4 days, good recovery
- **Push/Pull/Legs/Upper/Lower**: 5 days, balanced
- **Full body**: 3-4 days, time efficient

Include for each day:
- Workout type
- Target duration
- Location
- Exercise list with sets/reps/weight
- Specific notes

### Rest Day Programming

Don't just say "rest":
- Suggest optional activities (yoga, cardio, mobility)
- Reference gym class schedule if available
- Make it clear what's optional vs required

## Step 4: Generate the Plan

Create file: `plans/YYYY-WXX.md`

### Plan Structure

```markdown
---
week: "2025-W04"
start_date: "2025-01-20"
end_date: "2025-01-26"

[2-3 sentences: What's the focus this week? What's changing from last week? Any special considerations?]

---

---

## Tuesday, Jan 21 — Rest

[Reason for rest, optional activities]

---

[Continue for each day...]

---

## Week Notes

- [Any special considerations]
- [Things to watch for]
- [Adjustments to make if X happens]
```

## Step 5: Communicate the Plan

Send a summary to the user:

```
📅 **Week X Plan Ready**

Based on last week: [1-2 sentences of context]

**Schedule:**
• Mon: Push (bench 180 target 🎯)
• Tue: Rest (squash)
• Wed: Pull
• Thu: Legs (light)
• Fri: Upper
• Sat: Optional yoga

Reply /plan to see full details, or let me know if you want adjustments!
```

## Handling Missing Data

If workout data is incomplete:

1. Send message asking for missing info
2. Use available data to make best estimate
3. Note assumptions made in the plan
4. Build in flexibility for the unknown

## Deload Week Logic

Trigger a deload when 4+ weeks since last deload AND any of:
- RPE consistently >8.5
- Performance declining
- User reports fatigue
- Life stress is high

Deload structure:
- Reduce volume by 40-50%
- Maintain intensity (weight) or reduce slightly
- Focus on technique and recovery
- Include extra mobility/stretching

## Telegram Formatting

Plans are sent via Telegram, so format for mobile readability:

### Exercise Format

Use bold exercise names with bullet points underneath (NOT tables):

```
**Exercise Name**
- 4 × 6-8 @ 95 lbs
- Wall-assisted, focus on alignment

**Next Exercise**
- 3 × 12 @ bodyweight
```

### Message Breaks

Use `---` on its own line to indicate where to split into separate Telegram messages. This makes long plans easier to read on mobile.

Split by day - each training day should be its own message:

```
## Monday — Push

**Bench Press**
- 4 × 5 @ 175 lbs

**OHP**
- 3 × 8 @ 95 lbs

---

## Tuesday — Rest

Light stretching or yoga

---

## Wednesday — Pull
...
```

### Avoid

- Tables (they render poorly on mobile)
- Very long messages (split with `---`)
- Dense formatting without whitespace
