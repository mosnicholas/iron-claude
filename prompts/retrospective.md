# Weekly Retrospective Prompt

You are generating a weekly retrospective analysis. This runs Saturday evening before Sunday planning.

## Step 1: Gather Data

Read these files:
- Current week's data: `weeks/YYYY-WXX/`
  - `plan.md` — Weekly training plan
  - `YYYY-MM-DD.md` — Workout logs by date
- `prs.yaml` for PR achievements
- `learnings.md` for context

## Step 2: Calculate Metrics

### Adherence Rate
```
planned_sessions = count(planned workout days)
completed_sessions = count(workout logs with status=completed)
adherence_rate = completed_sessions / planned_sessions * 100
```

### Volume Analysis

Count total sets per category:
- **Push**: Chest, shoulders, triceps exercises
- **Pull**: Back, biceps exercises
- **Legs**: Quads, hamstrings, glutes, calves

Compare to previous week if available.

### PR Summary
- List all PRs hit this week
- Note type (weight, rep, estimated 1RM)
- Calculate improvement percentage

### Energy Trends
- Average energy level across sessions
- Any sessions with notably low/high energy
- Correlation with performance

### RPE Analysis
Analyze RPE patterns across the week:

**Strength Gains**: Look for exercises where the same RPE now corresponds to higher weights
- Example: "Your @8 on bench was 185 two weeks ago, now it's 195 - you're stronger!"

**Fatigue Detection**: Look for exercises where the same weight requires higher RPE
- Example: "OHP 115 has gone from @7 to @8.5 over 3 sessions - fatigue accumulating"

**Session Difficulty**: Calculate difficulty score for each session
- Based on average RPE, max RPE, and set count
- Categories: Easy (<40), Moderate (40-60), Hard (60-80), Brutal (80+)

## Step 3: Identify Patterns

### Positive Patterns
- What went well?
- Which exercises progressed?
- What scheduling worked?
- Any consistency improvements?

### Concerning Patterns
- Missed sessions (why?)
- Declining performance
- Persistent fatigue
- Recurring skips (same day/exercise)

### Behavioral Insights
- Time of day preferences
- Session duration preferences
- Equipment/exercise preferences
- Response to modifications

## Step 4: Generate Recommendations

Based on analysis, recommend:

1. **For next week's plan**
   - Volume adjustments
   - Exercise swaps
   - Scheduling changes
   - Intensity modifications

2. **For the client**
   - Focus areas
   - Recovery suggestions
   - Habit improvements

3. **For learnings.md**
   - New patterns to record
   - Preferences discovered
   - Important context

## Step 5: Create Retrospective

Create file: `weeks/YYYY-WXX/retro.md`

### Retrospective Structure

## Step 6: Update Learnings

If new patterns were discovered:

1. Read current `learnings.md`
2. Add new insights under appropriate category
3. Update date at bottom
4. Commit: "Update learnings: [brief description]"

## Step 7: Notify User

Send summary via Telegram:

```
📊 **Week X Retrospective**

**Adherence:** 4/5 sessions (80%)
**PRs:** Bench 185×3 (Weight PR) 🎉
**Total Volume:** 45 sets

**Wins:**
• Bench moving well
• Consistent morning schedule

**Watch:**
• Thursday energy was low
• Leg volume down

Full retro saved. Ready to plan Week X+1 tomorrow!
```

## Handling Incomplete Data

If workout logs are missing:

1. Note which days are missing
2. Ask user if they want to fill in
3. If no response by planning time:
   - Use available data
   - Note gaps in retrospective
   - Don't penalize adherence for truly missing data
