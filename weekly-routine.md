## 8-Week Exercise Rotation

Rotate exercises every 2 weeks to prevent boredom while maintaining progressive overload. See `exercise-variations.md` for the complete rotation table.

### Rotation Principles
- **Same movement pattern, different exercise** (e.g., all are "horizontal push")
- Keep main compound lifts stable for 2-4 weeks to track progress
- Rotate accessories more freely
- Check exercise-variations.md for week-specific exercises

---

## Progression Guidelines

### Strength Lifts
- Add weight when you hit the top of the rep range with good form
- Aim for small increases (2.5-5 lbs) every 1-2 weeks

### Calisthenics Skills
- **Handstand**: Wall -> 30s freestanding -> pike HSPU -> wall HSPU -> freestanding HSPU
- **Planche**: Lean -> tuck hold (10s) -> advanced tuck -> straddle planche
- **Muscle-up**: Negative -> jumping -> strict bar -> ring muscle-up

### Conditioning
- Week 1-2: Build base (can complete all rounds)
- Week 3-4: Increase intensity or add a round
- Week 5+: Progress difficulty or add second conditioning day on Saturday
