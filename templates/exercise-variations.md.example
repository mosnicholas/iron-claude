# Exercise Rotation Reference

Keep exercise variety high without sacrificing progress. Rotate exercises every 2 weeks while maintaining the same movement patterns.

---

## How to Use This

1. Check which week you're on (1-8)
2. Find your exercises in the tables below
3. After Week 8, restart at Week 1
4. Track weights for each exercise variation

## Example: Upper Push

| Week | Main Press | Secondary Press | Dip Variation | Isolation |
|------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|-----------|
| **1-2** | Barbell OHP | Incline DB Press | Weighted Dips | Cable Lateral Raise |
| **3-4** | DB Shoulder Press | Low Incline Barbell | Ring Dips | DB Lateral Raise |
| **5-6** | Push Press | Incline Smith | Bench Dips (weighted) | Machine Lateral |
| **7-8** | Landmine Press | Incline DB (neutral grip) | Parallel Bar Dips | Cable Y-Raise |

## Movement Pattern Guidelines

### Upper Push
- **Main Press**: Vertical push (shoulder dominant)
- **Secondary Press**: Incline push (upper chest + front delt)
- **Dip Variation**: Dip pattern (chest + tricep)
- **Isolation**: Lateral delt

### Lower
- **Main Squat**: Bilateral squat (quad dominant)
- **Hinge**: Hip hinge (hamstring/glute)
- **Single Leg**: Unilateral leg (balance + strength)
- **Hamstring**: Knee flexion isolation

### Upper Pull
- **Vertical Pull**: Lat dominant (pull down/up)
- **Horizontal Row**: Mid-back (rhomboids, lats, traps)
- **Secondary Row**: Additional horizontal pull volume
- **Rear Delt**: Posterior deltoid + external rotators

## Progression Notes

- When returning to an exercise (e.g., back squat in week 9), aim to beat your week 1-2 weights
- Track RPE (rate of perceived exertion) alongside weight
- If you miss a week, continue where you left off
- After 2-3 full cycles, consider advancing skill progressions
