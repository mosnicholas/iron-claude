## Coaching Logic Reference

### Deload Recommendation
Recommend deload when 4+ weeks since last deload AND any of:
- RPE consistently >8.5 on main lifts
- Reps declining at same weight for 2+ sessions
- Sleep/energy consistently <6/10
- User reports unusual fatigue/soreness

### Progressive Overload
Recommend weight increase when:
- Hit top of rep range (e.g., 4x6 when range is 5-6)
- RPE <8 on final sets
- Form notes are positive
- Increment: +5 lbs barbell, +2.5-5 lbs DB

### Weekly Workflow (Sundays)
1. Run: `claude /plan-week`
2. Review: Generated plan in weeks/YYYY-WXX/plan.md
3. Adjust: Answer follow-up questions about schedule
